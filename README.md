# Introduction

In today‚Äôs data-driven job market, understanding the dynamics of roles, required skills, and compensation is critical for aspiring and current data analysts. This project uses SQL to explore job posting data and answer key questions around **salary trends** and **in-demand skills** in the field of data analytics.

# Background

In today's data-centric world, organizations across industries are hiring Data Analysts to turn raw data into actionable insights. However, the job market is highly dynamic‚Äîsalary levels and skill requirements vary significantly depending on industry trends, location, and technological adoption.

This project was created to explore those questions using real-world job data. By querying job postings with SQL, I aimed to uncover patterns in salary, demand, and skill relevance to help guide data professionals‚Äîwhether beginners or experienced analysts‚Äîtoward smarter skill development.

## The goal of the project is to:

- Identify **top-paying Data Analyst roles**
- Uncover which **skills are associated with those roles**
- Determine the **most in-demand skills** across the industry
- Analyze which skills **command higher salaries**
- Recommend the **most optimal skills to learn** for maximizing career growth

# üõ†Ô∏è Tools I Used

- **SQL (PostgreSQL)** ‚Äì Used to write queries and extract meaningful insights from the job and skill datasets.
- **VS Code** ‚Äì My code editor for writing and organizing SQL scripts efficiently.
- **Git & GitHub** ‚Äì For version control, collaboration, and hosting the project online.

# The Analysis

Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

### 1. üí∞ Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs

This query retrieves the **top 10 highest-paying remote Data Analyst jobs** from the dataset. It filters job postings with non-null salary data, limits results to roles labeled ‚ÄúData Analyst,‚Äù and only considers **remote positions** (where `job_location = 'Anywhere'`).

#### ‚úÖ SQL Query Used:

```sql
SELECT
    job_title,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_location,
    job_posted_date::DATE,
    name AS company_name
FROM job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim
    ON company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id
WHERE
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere'
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## üîç Insights

From the analysis, several general insights emerged:

1. **üí∏ Top-Paying Data Analyst Jobs**  
   Remote data analyst jobs offer a wide salary range, with the highest reaching **$650,000**, highlighting the lucrative potential in remote tech roles.

2. **üß† Skills for Top-Paying Jobs**  
   Jobs that pay the most consistently require advanced proficiency in **SQL**, establishing it as a critical skill for earning top-tier salaries.

3. **üìà Most In-Demand Skill**  
   **SQL** stands out not only for salary potential but also for its demand across job listings, making it an essential skill for aspiring data analysts.

4. **üíº Skills with Higher Salaries**  
   Specialized technologies like **SVN** and **Solidity** are linked to higher average salaries, showing that niche technical expertise is highly valued in the job market.

5. **üèÜ Optimal Skill for Market Value**  
   Among all analyzed skills, **SQL** strikes the best balance between demand and compensation, making it the most strategic skill to master for maximizing job market value.
